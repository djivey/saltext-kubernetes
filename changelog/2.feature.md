# Added Comprehensive Testing Suite and Enhanced State Module Functionality

## Renamed the state module kubernetesmod to kubernetes due to a conflict with the salt core state module kubernetes

## Testing Infrastructure
- Implemented pytest-based testing framework
- Added pytest fixtures for handling Kubernetes resources:
  - Template management with `pytest.helpers.temp_file`
  - Kubernetes state module access
  - Resource templates (namespace, pod, deployment, service, configmap, secret)
  - Cluster configuration management

## Resource Management Tests
Added comprehensive functional tests covering:
- Namespace management (creation, deletion, templating)
- Pod lifecycle (creation, deletion, template support)
- Deployment operations (creation, updates, deletion)
- Secret handling (creation, updates, base64 encoding)
- Service configuration (ports, selectors, types)
- ConfigMap management (data handling, updates)
- Node label operations (single labels and folder-based management)

## Template Support
- Added Jinja2 template support for all resource types
- Implemented context-based resource creation:
  - Namespace templates with label support
  - Pod templates with container configuration
  - Deployment templates with replica and selector support
  - Service templates with flexible port configuration
  - ConfigMap templates with multi-line data support
  - Secret templates with data encoding support

## State Module Improvements
- Enhanced idempotency checks for all operations
- Improved error handling and status reporting
- Added proper cleanup procedures
- Implemented validation for resource configurations
- Added support for handling different resource states (e.g. "Terminating")

## Testing Best Practices
- Added proper test isolation
- Implemented consistent cleanup after tests
- Added delays where needed for cluster operations
- Improved assertion messages and error handling
- Added logging support for better debugging

## Documentation
- Added detailed docstrings for all test functions
- Included usage examples in test cases
- Documented template structures and context usage
- Added comments explaining complex operations
