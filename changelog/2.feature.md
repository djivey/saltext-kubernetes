# Added Comprehensive Testing Suite and Enhanced State Module Functionality

Renamed the state module kubernetesmod to kubernetes due to a conflict with the salt core state module kubernetes

## Testing Infrastructure
Implemented pytest-based testing framework with pytest-kind
Added pytest fixtures for handling Kubernetes resources:
  - Template management with `pytest.helpers.temp_file`
  - Resource templates (namespace, pod, deployment, service, configmap, secret)
  - Cluster configuration management
  - Configurable Kubernetes version testing

## Resource Management Tests
Added functional and integration tests covering:
- Namespace management (creation, deletion, templating)
- Pod lifecycle (creation, deletion, template support)
- Deployment operations (creation, updates, deletion)
- Secret handling (creation, updates, base64 encoding)
- Service configuration (ports, selectors, types)
- ConfigMap management (data handling, updates)
- Node label operations (single labels and folder-based management)

## Template Support
Added Jinja2 template support for all resource types
Implemented context-based resource creation:
  - Namespace templates with label support
  - Pod templates with container configuration
  - Deployment templates with replica and selector support
  - Service templates with flexible port configuration
  - ConfigMap templates with multi-line data support
  - Secret templates with data encoding support

## Spec Validation Enhancements
- Base64 encoding validation for secrets
- Service port configuration validation
- ConfigMap data consistency checks
- Namespace state validation
- Deployment spec verification
- Container configuration validation

## Documentation
Added detailed docstrings for all test functions
Included usage examples in test cases
Documented template structures and context usage
Added comments explaining complex operations
