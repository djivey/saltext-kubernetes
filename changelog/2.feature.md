# Added Template Context Support and Improved Secret Management

## Template Context Support
Added support for using context in templates for `deployment_present`, `pod_present`, `service_present`, `configmap_present`, and `secret_present` states
Added comprehensive examples in docstrings showing context usage with templates

## Secret Management Improvements
Enhanced `create_secret` and `replace_secret` to handle base64 encoded values intelligently:
  - Added detection of pre-encoded base64 strings
  - Preserves already encoded values
  - Only encodes plain text values
Added support for docker registry secrets (type kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson)
Preserves secret type when replacing existing secrets
Updated docstrings with examples for both plain text and pre-encoded values

## Service Specification Enhancement
Improved `__dict_to_service_spec()` with:
  - Proper validation of required port values
  - Better initialization of service port configurations
  - Support for detailed port specifications

## Connection Handling
Simplified kubeconfig handling in `_setup_conn`
Removed the ability to override individual kubeconfig options to prevent conflicts
Better error handling for kubeconfig loading
